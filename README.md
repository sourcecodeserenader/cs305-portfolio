# CS 305 Module Eight Journal: Reflection and Portfolio Submission

## 1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements.  
Artemis Financial, a client centered around secure financial services, tasked us with ensuring their software systems were fortified against vulnerabilities. Their primary concern was protecting sensitive client data while maintaining operational stability and security trustworthiness.

## 2. What did you do well when you found your client's software security vulnerabilities?  
I took the vulnerabilities seriously, treating each one as a gateway someone else could exploit if I left it untouched. I approached the findings methodically, patching issues while maintaining the software’s natural flow. Secure coding protects not just the product but the company’s identity - preserving trust, safeguarding livelihoods, and preventing collapse from breaches that often strike where eyes fail to see.

## 3. Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?  
The most challenging part was differentiating between critical and noncritical vulnerabilities - seeing beyond the surface and weighing the potential real world impact of each flaw. That challenge was also the most rewarding because it deepened my discernment and sharpened my instincts.

---

## 4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?  
I layered security through code refactoring, dependency checks, encryption practices, and continuous validation of external libraries. In the future, I would implement automated vulnerability scanners early in the development cycle, integrate threat modeling sessions, and use mitigation frameworks like OWASP ASVS to design more proactively.

---

## 5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?  
After each adjustment, I reran the OWASP Dependency Check, reviewed logs for anomalies, and manually inspected key functionality to confirm that no new issues emerged. I treated every update not as a fix alone but as a possible weak point until proven otherwise.

---

## 6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?  
The most valuable practices were dependency checking through Maven plugins, checksum verification for file integrity, and applying secure coding principles like input validation and least privilege access. These are timeless strategies I can adapt to any secure software project going forward.

---

## 7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?  
I would showcase this project to demonstrate not just technical competency in code analysis and security mitigation, but also critical thinking, attention to detail, and documentation - all essential traits when protecting real-world systems that people trust with their lives and futures.
